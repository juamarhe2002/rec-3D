# Code implementation of the algorithmic approach and the DeepLearning approach

This repository contains the code implementation of the methods explained on my theses for both the algorithmic approach (on the `algorithmic` folder) and the DeepLearning approach (on the `Pytorch3D` folder).
To run each one of the respective code implementations please refer to each individual folder where the steps are explained.
